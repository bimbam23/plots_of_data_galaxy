### About PlotsOfData

coming soon

### Running the App

Currently, the app can only run from R/Rstudio.

Or download it to use it offline:

-download the app.R and csv files with example data.

-Run RStudio and load app.R

-Select 'Run All' (shortcut is command-option-R on a Mac) or click on "Run App" (upper right button on the window)

This should launch a web browser with the Shiny app.
Note that the app depends on several R packages that need to be installed (shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, magrittr, ggbeeswarm, readxl)
