this app was adapted from https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/Plotsofdata/

### About plots_of_data_galaxy

The goal of this project is to implement the most frequently used and needed plots in galaxy. In addition the idea is to make them interactive and easy to plot starting from any data.frame (table) object.

### Running the App

Currently, the app can only run from R/Rstudio.

Or download it to use it offline:

-download the app.R and csv files with example data.

-Run RStudio and load app.R

-Select 'Run All' (shortcut is command-option-R on a Mac) or click on "Run App" (upper right button on the window)

This should launch a web browser with the Shiny app.
Note that the app depends on several R packages that need to be installed (shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, magrittr, ggbeeswarm, readxl)
